# 3220_final
3220 Final Project - Ian Naeger, Christopher Smith

** Project proposal **
We intend to build a casino like gaming experience, one which will contain several mini games that the user can play
we want to allow the user to create an account, save their high scores and averages, to be able to compare them to other users
there will also be an option to play as a guest (base class) which allows the user to play the games without tracking progress
playing as a user account (inheritance of the base class) will give access to the leaderboard and other functionality
there will also be cheat codes, when entered will have several options, your scores could be scaled, offset if youd wish, there will also be options to blatantly ignore some functionality of some games (dynamic binding) to make them much easiet to play!
cheat codes will only be available to the two creator accounts (another inherited class) and namely, chris and ian, who will have passwords (most likely defined in the header files)
users will be able to delete their accounts (and memory must be freed correctly here)
*POSSIBLE* hardware implementation - have one of the games be on a physical board for the user to play (simon says or something that includes LEDs and buttons)
main functionality will be the points system, which needs to be kept track of and updated with each game played

**Design strategy**
_coding one thing at a time_
>get all of the games working so that we can play them seperately and no bugs occur (probably just have to print scores out)
>get the guest user class working with these games
>introduce the user accounts and file processing
>overload the functions and introduce dynamic binding with the cheat code option
